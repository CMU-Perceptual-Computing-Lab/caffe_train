# Caffe_train

Our modified caffe for training multi-person pose estimator. The original caffe version is in July 2016. This repository at least runs on Ubuntu 14.04, OpenCV 2.4.10, CUDA 7.5/8.0, and CUDNN 5. 

The [full project repo](https://github.com/ZheC/Realtime_Multi-Person_Pose_Estimation) includes detailed training steps and the testing code in matlab, C++ and python.

We add customized caffe layer for data augmentation: [cpm_data_transformer.cpp](https://github.com/CMU-Perceptual-Computing-Lab/caffe_train/blob/master/src/caffe/cpm_data_transformer.cpp), including scale augmentation e.g., in the range of 0.7 to 1.3, rotation augmentation, e.g., in the range of -40 to 40 degrees, flip augmentation and image cropping. This augmentation strategy makes the method capable of dealing with a large range of scales and orientations. You can set the augmentation parameters in [setLayers.py](https://github.com/ZheC/Realtime_Multi-Person_Pose_Estimation/blob/master/training/setLayers.py). Example data layer parameters in the [training prototxt](https://github.com/ZheC/Realtime_Multi-Person_Pose_Estimation/blob/master/training/example_proto/pose_train_test.prototxt) is:

```
layer {
  name: "data"
  type: "CPMData"
  top: "data"
  top: "label"
  data_param {
    source: "/home/zhecao/COCO_kpt/lmdb_trainVal"
    batch_size: 10
    backend: LMDB
  }
  cpm_transform_param {
    stride: 8
    max_rotate_degree: 40
    visualize: false
    crop_size_x: 368
    crop_size_y: 368
    scale_prob: 1
    scale_min: 0.5
    scale_max: 1.1
    target_dist: 0.6
    center_perterb_max: 40
    do_clahe: false
    num_parts: 56
    np_in_lmdb: 17
  }
}
```
